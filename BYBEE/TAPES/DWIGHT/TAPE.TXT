 This tape has the following files. The same files are duplicated
on each side of the tape. If one side is damaged or unreadable
give the other side a try. It is recommended that one make
copies of this tap. TPERR is useful for making copies.
 There are two copies of STARTRK these will only work if you have
the two PROMs for TinyBasic installed. The second one includes
TinyBasic extended functions of PEEK, POKE and SAVE. Look at the
DOS file for SAVTBS.PRN to see how these functions work. If you
have the TinyBasic ROMs installed, you can load this file and start
a new program by the NEW command. Any future programs will keep
these fuctions when saved with SAVE.
