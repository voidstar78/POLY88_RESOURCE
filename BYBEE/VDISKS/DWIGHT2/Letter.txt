Hi Bob

Attached are both the collection of the 5.25 disk that I extracted 
images from a few years ago and the 8 inch disk that was just done.

The 8 inch include the BASIC last used. I noticed that they had
4 options. They had combinations of 8 or 14 digits and software or hardware floating point. 
The hardware floating point used the North Star floating point board ( I may have one of those ).

There is source disk and generation disk in the 8 inch files as we.
I would suspect I could get files loaded by using the FTP program if I want to play with them.

Some of the code in the 5.25 library refers to a hard drive as well.
There is some test code for CP/M compatibility as well. 

In the 5.25 library is a disk called KENO. On it is a version of FORTH.GO I'll try to find time to play with it.

Many of the disk are text file. I've expanded them with 0Dh to 0Dh 0Ah for ease of reading on a windows machine. I'm not sure how the poly would like those.

The images are included so they could be easily extracted.

There are a number of complete system images that could be loaded on your emulator.

Have fun looking through them. Some of the source disk will most likely have names you remember.
