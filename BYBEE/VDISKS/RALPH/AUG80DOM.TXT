Dear Subscriber,

This disk contains programs written by many different people.
Most of them are self-explanatory, but some may need a bit of
tutoring.


1) POP.GO will change a system file to a non-system file and
vice-versa.
		$POP <3>TESTFILE


2) SZAP.GO  Put in a backup disc and go to town. To look at
the directory on disk 2 type:
$ENABLE
$$SZAP
When it comes up, read the directions, then type:
:2
and a RETURN. You will be looking at the directory. Type ESC
and the ASCII equilivent will show up on the right. Scan
through the disc by hitting RETURN.  Back up with LINE FEED.

A detailed writeup on this program appeared in the November/
December 1981 issue of PolyLetter.


3)MOVE.BS  A free suprise program!!  By Donald Moe, it will
move data from one disc to another.  Tell it the starting 
address and how many sectors.  Very useful if you have a
destroyed directory.

4)COPYALL.BS  Will move all non-system files to another disk.

5)COPY-SUB-DIR  The same but will work only from a subdirectory

For the other programs, type them in and go.


Thank you!
